What is [Your App Name]?

This is not just another quiz app. It's a complete, integrated Digital Study Ecosystem designed to fix the two biggest problems in UPSC preparation: fragmented practice and a lack of quality feedback.

Our platform is built on one simple idea: what if your practice questions, your written answers, your personal notes, and your revision material were all connected in one smart, searchable system?

Here is what our product does for you.

1. The "Smart" Prelims Engine

The problem with most prelims practice is that it's "dumb." You answer a question, see an explanation, and move on. Bookmarking just creates a junk drawer of 1,000 questions you'll never see again.

Our system is different.

Practice Thousands of Questions: Access a massive, blazingly-fast question bank of Prelims PYQs and practice tests.

Get "Ultimate Explanations": We provide in-depth, "how to think" explanations that go far beyond a simple "A is correct."

Build a Personal, Filterable Library: This is the core feature. When you bookmark a question, it doesn't just go into a giant list. It goes into your personal, queryable library.

Add Your Own Annotations: Add your own notes, thoughts, and mnemonics to any question you save.

Find What You Need, Instantly: For the first time, you can filter your saved library.

"Show me all my 'Polity' bookmarks."

"Show me all the 'History' questions I saved from 2024."

"Show me all my bookmarks that I annotated with the word 'important'."

2. The "Instant" Mains Evaluator

Getting feedback on Mains answers is slow, expensive, and inconsistent. Our platform gives you an AI-powered co-pilot to grade your answers instantly.

Instant AI Feedback: Submit your handwritten or typed answers for any Mains question (PYQ or custom). Our AI will provide a detailed evaluation in seconds, analyzing your structure, clarity, introduction, conclusion, and how well you addressed the question's demands.

Build a Personal Archive of Your Progress: We don't just grade your answer and forget it. We save every single evaluation in your private, searchable archive.

Track Your Improvement: Your archive is not a "junk drawer"; it's a powerful tool. You can instantly filter and find all your past answers for a specific topic.

"Show me all my evaluated answers for 'GS2 - Governance'."

"Show me my scores for all 'Modern History' questions I've written."

"Let me review my last 5 answers on 'Ethics' to see if my scores are improving."

3. The "360° Topic Hub" (The Final Connection)

This is the revolutionary feature that connects everything. The UPSC syllabus is vague, so we've built our own "Master Topic Tree" (a micro-syllabus) and tagged every single piece of content to it.

When you click any topic in our app (e.g., "Polity -> Judiciary"), you land on a single "Topic Hub" that shows you:

[Tab 1] All Prelims PYQs related to "Judiciary."

[Tab 2] All Mains PYQs related to "Judiciary."

[Tab 3] All of your bookmarked Prelims questions for "Judiciary."

[Tab 4] All of your evaluated Mains answers for "Judiciary."

[Tab 5] All relevant Lexicon terms, Quotes, and Case Studies for "Judiciary."

It's the ultimate revision tool, connecting all your practice and study material into one single, powerful, and integrated experience.
