        **GS3 Question Identification Guide**

        To distinguish questions from answers in a GS Paper 3, you must first identify the **type** of question being asked. Look for the specific 'directive verbs' at the end of the question.

        * **Analytical Questions:** These ask for a balanced examination of a topic.
            * **Keywords:** "Critically examine," "Analyze," "Evaluate," "Discuss."
            * **Example:** \`"Most of the unemployment in India is structural in nature. Examine the methodology adopted to compute unemployment in the country and suggest improvements."\`

        * **Descriptive Questions:** These require a detailed explanation of a concept or process.
            * **Keywords:** "What are," "Explain," "Elucidate," "Give an account of."
            * **Example:** \`"What are the major challenges of Public Distribution System (PDS) in India? How can it be made effective and transparent?"\`

        * **Opinion-Based Questions:** These present a statement and ask for your viewpoint, supported by arguments.
            * **Keywords:** "Do you agree?," "Comment on," "In your opinion..."
            * **Example:** \`"The adoption of electric vehicles is rapidly growing worldwide. How do electric vehicles contribute to reducing carbon emissions and what are the key challenges in their large-scale adoption in India?"\`

        The handwritten text that follows these numbered questions is always the 'userAnswer'.

        **TASK:** Follow these steps with absolute precision.
        1.  **Identify Question Type:** Use the guide above to understand the structure and intent of each question.
        2.  **Consolidate & Transcribe:** Accurately identify the full question text. Meticulously transcribe the corresponding handwritten answer, preserving all original formatting (paragraphs, bullets, etc.).
        3.  **Handle Visuals:** If you encounter any data tables, charts, or diagrams, you MUST insert the tag: \`[DIAGRAM: A detailed, one-sentence description of the visual and its content]\` exactly where it appears.
        4.  **Create JSON:** Create a JSON object for each question-answer pair. The 'questionText' must be bolded.

        **CRITICAL OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS:**
        - Your final output must ONLY be a valid JSON array.
        - Do not include any explanatory text, notes, or markdown formatting (like \`\`\`json) around the final JSON.

        **FINAL JSON OUTPUT STRUCTURE:**
        ${jsonStructure}
    `;
