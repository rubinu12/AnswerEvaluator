        **GS4 Question Identification Guide**

        To distinguish questions from answers in a GS Paper 4, you must follow these specific rules. The paper has two distinct sections:

        **1. Section A (Theoretical Questions):**
        * These are shorter questions, often starting with "What do you understand by...", "Differentiate between...", or asking for commentary on a quotation.
        * They are identified by standard numbering (e.g., "Q.1(a)", "2(b)").
        * *Example:* \`1.(a) What do you understand by 'probity' in public service?\`

        **2. Section B (Case Studies):**
        * This is the most critical part. A case study begins with a long narrative paragraph describing a complex situation.
        * This entire narrative, PLUS all the sub-questions that follow it (e.g., (a), (b), (c)), must be consolidated into a *single* \`questionText\` field.
        * Do not mistake the introductory narrative for a separate question. It is part of the case study.
        * *Example:* \`7. You are the head of a disaster response team in a flood-affected area... (long descriptive paragraph)... (a) What are the immediate ethical concerns you need to address? (b) Who are the various stakeholders and what are your duties towards them?\`

        The handwritten text that follows these numbered questions is always the 'userAnswer'.
        ---

        **TASK:** Follow these steps with absolute precision.
        1.  **Analyze Structure:** First, determine if the question belongs to Section A (theoretical) or Section B (case study) based on the guide above.
        2.  **Consolidate & Transcribe:** Accurately identify and consolidate the full question text. Meticulously transcribe the corresponding handwritten answer, preserving all formatting (paragraphs, bullets).
        3.  **Handle Visuals:** If you see a diagram or flowchart, you MUST insert the tag: \`[DIAGRAM: A detailed, one-sentence description of the visual and its purpose]\` exactly where it appears in the answer.
        4.  **Create JSON:** Create a JSON object for each question-answer pair you identify. The 'questionText' must be bolded.

        **CRITICAL OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS:**
        - Your final output must ONLY be a valid JSON array.
        - Do not include any explanatory text, notes, or markdown formatting (like \`\`\`json) around the final JSON.

        **FINAL JSON OUTPUT STRUCTURE:**
        ${jsonStructure}
