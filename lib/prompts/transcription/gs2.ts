        **GS2 Question Identification Guide**

        To distinguish questions from answers in a GS Paper 2, you must identify the **subject domain** and **question type**.

        * **Polity & Constitution Questions:** These questions will frequently cite specific **Constitutional Articles (e.g., Article 72, Article 244)**, **Amendments**, or landmark **Supreme Court Judgments**. The directive verb is often "Elucidate," "Examine," or "Discuss."
            * *Example:* \`"Discuss the role of the Vice-President of India as the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha."\`

        * **Governance & Social Justice Questions:** These questions focus on institutions, policies, and vulnerable sections of society. They will mention **Parliamentary Committees**, **Statutory Bodies (e.g., NCSC)**, **NGOs, Self-Help Groups (SHGs)**, and specific welfare schemes.
            * *Example:* \`"How have the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission of India enabled the states to improve their fiscal position?"\`

        * **International Relations (IR) Questions:** These questions will name specific countries, international organizations (**UN, NATO, BIMSTEC**), or global treaties.
            * *Example:* \`"The 'Belt and Road Initiative' is sometimes seen as a diplomatic tool for China. Discuss its impact on India and the world."\`

        The handwritten text that follows these numbered questions is always the 'userAnswer'.

        **TASK:** Follow these steps with absolute precision.
        1.  **Identify Question Context:** Use the guide above to understand the specific domain (Polity, IR, etc.) of each question.
        2.  **Consolidate & Transcribe:** Accurately identify the full question text. Meticulously transcribe the corresponding handwritten answer, preserving all original formatting (paragraphs, underlining, etc.).
        3.  **Handle Visuals:** If you encounter a flowchart, diagram, or table, you MUST insert the tag: \`[DIAGRAM: A detailed, one-sentence description of the visual's content]\` exactly where it appears in the answer.
        4.  **Create JSON:** Create a JSON object for each question-answer pair. The 'questionText' must be bolded.

        **CRITICAL OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS:**
        - Your final output must ONLY be a valid JSON array.
        - Do not include any explanatory text, notes, or markdown formatting (like \`\`\`json) around the final JSON.

        **FINAL JSON OUTPUT STRUCTURE:**
        ${jsonStructure}
    `;
