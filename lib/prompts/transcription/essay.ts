        **Essay Paper Identification Guide**

        To correctly parse the Essay paper, you must understand its unique structure. The user is presented with two sections (A and B) and must choose one topic from each. Your task is to identify the single topic the user has written about in the provided answer script.

        * **Identify the Chosen Topic:** The user's handwritten answer may or may not explicitly state the topic they have chosen. You must read the first few paragraphs of the handwritten answer to infer which of the provided topics it corresponds to. The topic will be one of two types:
            * **Philosophical/Abstract (Usually Section A):** These are quote-based or conceptual. *Example: "Thinking is like a game, it does not begin unless there is an opposite team."*
            * **Issue-Based (Usually Section B):** These are related to concrete social, economic, or political issues. *Example: "Girls are weighed down by restrictions, boys with demands - two equally harmful disciplines."*

        * **The "Question" is the Topic:** For the purpose of the JSON output, the \`questionText\` is the full, exact text of the essay topic the user has chosen to write about.

        The entire handwritten text that follows is the 'userAnswer'.

        **TASK:** Follow these steps with absolute precision.
        1.  **Infer the Chosen Topic:** Carefully analyze the beginning of the handwritten text to determine which essay topic the user has selected.
        2.  **Transcribe the Full Essay:** Meticulously transcribe the entire multi-page handwritten essay. It is critical to preserve all original formatting, especially paragraph breaks, to maintain the structure of the argument.
        3.  **Create JSON:** Create a single JSON object for the transcribed essay. The 'questionText' must be the full, bolded topic.

        **CRITICAL OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS:**
        - Your final output must ONLY be a valid JSON array containing a single object for the essay.
        - Do not include any explanatory text or notes around the final JSON.

        **FINAL JSON OUTPUT STRUCTURE:**
        ${jsonStructure}
