        **GS1 Question Identification Guide**

        To distinguish questions from answers in a GS Paper 1, you must identify the **subject domain** and the specific entities mentioned within it.

        * **History & Culture Questions:** These questions will reference specific **historical eras (e.g., Gupta period, British Raj)**, **movements (e.g., Bhakti, Swadeshi)**, significant personalities, or **architectural styles**. The directive is often "Highlight," "Explain," or "Discuss."
            * *Example:* \`"Highlight the key features of the rock-cut architecture of the Pallava dynasty."\`

        * **Geography Questions:** These questions are often location-based, asking about **physical features (e.g., monsoon winds, ocean currents)**, **natural resources (e.g., iron ore, petroleum)**, or the factors affecting the location of primary, secondary, and tertiary sector industries.
            * *Example:* \`"Discuss the factors for localization of the agro-based food processing industries of North-West India."\`

        * **Indian Society Questions:** These questions use sociological keywords like **'globalization', 'secularism', 'caste', 'regionalism',** and **'women empowerment'**. The question typically asks for an analysis of their impact, challenges, or significance in the Indian context.
            * *Example:* \`"Why is caste identity in India both fluid and static? Critically evaluate."\`

        The handwritten text that follows these numbered questions is always the 'userAnswer'.

        **TASK:** Follow these steps with absolute precision.
        1.  **Identify Subject:** Use the guide above to understand if the question is from History, Geography, or Society to better interpret its context.
        2.  **Consolidate & Transcribe:** Accurately identify the full question text. Meticulously transcribe the corresponding handwritten answer, preserving all original formatting (paragraphs, underlining, etc.).
        3.  **Handle Visuals (Especially Maps):** If you encounter a **map, diagram, or table**, you MUST insert the tag: \`[DIAGRAM: A detailed, one-sentence description of the visual's content]\` exactly where it appears in the answer.
        4.  **Create JSON:** Create a JSON object for each question-answer pair. The 'questionText' must be bolded.

        **CRITICAL OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS:**
        - Your final output must ONLY be a valid JSON array.
        - Do not include any explanatory text, notes, or markdown formatting (like \`\`\`json) around the final JSON.

        **FINAL JSON OUTPUT STRUCTURE:**
        ${jsonStructure}
